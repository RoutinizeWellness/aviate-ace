# Netlify Convex Integration Guide

## Current Status
✅ All configurations are properly set up for Netlify to detect Convex
✅ Convex URL is correctly configured in both .env and netlify.toml
✅ Convex dependency is properly listed in package.json
✅ convex.ts file is using ES6 imports instead of require()

## Configuration Verification

### Environment Variables
The following environment variables are properly configured:

1. **.env file**:
   ```
   VITE_CONVEX_URL="https://accomplished-swordfish-668.convex.cloud"
   ```

2. **netlify.toml**:
   ```toml
   [context.production.environment]
     VITE_CONVEX_URL = "https://accomplished-swordfish-668.convex.cloud"
   ```

### Package Dependencies
Convex is properly listed in package.json dependencies:
```json
"dependencies": {
  "convex": "^1.13.0",
  // ... other dependencies
}
```

### File Structure
The convex.ts file has been updated to use ES6 imports:
```typescript
import { useMutation as convexUseMutation, useQuery as convexUseQuery } from "convex/react";
import { api as generatedApi } from "../../convex/_generated/api";

const useMutation = convexUseMutation;
const useQuery = convexUseQuery;
const api = generatedApi;

console.log('✅ Convex modules imported successfully');

export { useMutation, useQuery, api };
```

## Deployment Process

### 1. Verify Configuration
Before deploying, verify all configurations are correct:
```bash
npm run verify:netlify
```

### 2. Deploy to Netlify
Deploy the application to Netlify:
```bash
npm run deploy:netlify
```

### 3. Post-Deployment Verification
After deployment, check the browser console for:
- ✅ "Convex client initialized successfully"
- ❌ Ensure "Convex not available, using fallback" no longer appears

## Troubleshooting "Convex not available, using fallback"

If you still see the "Convex not available, using fallback" message after deployment:

### 1. Check Browser Console
Look for specific error messages that might indicate what's failing.

### 2. Verify Environment Variables
Ensure VITE_CONVEX_URL is properly set in Netlify environment variables:
1. Go to Netlify Dashboard
2. Select your site
3. Go to Site settings > Build & deploy > Environment
4. Verify VITE_CONVEX_URL is set to: https://accomplished-swordfish-668.convex.cloud

### 3. Check Network Requests
In browser developer tools, check if requests to the Convex URL are successful:
- Look for requests to: https://accomplished-swordfish-668.convex.cloud
- Check that they return 200 status codes

### 4. Verify Convex Deployment
Check that the Convex deployment is active:
```bash
npx convex status
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: ES Module vs CommonJS
**Problem**: Mixing require() and import statements
**Solution**: Use consistent ES6 imports as shown in the updated convex.ts file

### Issue 2: Environment Variable Not Set
**Problem**: VITE_CONVEX_URL not available in production
**Solution**: Ensure it's set in netlify.toml and Netlify environment variables

### Issue 3: Network Connectivity
**Problem**: Browser blocking requests to Convex domain
**Solution**: Check browser security settings and ensure no ad blockers are interfering

## Testing the Integration

### 1. Local Testing
Test locally to ensure Convex integration works:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Visit http://localhost:8080 and check browser console.

### 2. Production Testing
After Netlify deployment:
1. Visit your Netlify site
2. Open browser developer tools
3. Check console for Convex initialization messages
4. Verify no fallback warnings appear

## Verification Commands

### Check Convex Status
```bash
npx convex status
```

### Verify Configuration
```bash
npm run verify:netlify
```

### Check Question Count
```bash
npx convex run seedQuestions:getExamQuestionsCount
```

## Next Steps

1. Deploy to Netlify: `npm run deploy:netlify`
2. After deployment, visit your site
3. Check browser console for successful Convex initialization
4. Verify that exam questions are loaded from Convex (should see 194 questions)
5. Test all application features that require backend connectivity

The integration is now properly configured to ensure Netlify detects Convex and initializes it correctly without falling back to the mock implementation.
