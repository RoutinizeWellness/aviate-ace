git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

**Use GitHub Codespaces**

- Navigate to the main page of your repository.
- Click on the "Code" button (green button) near the top right.

## What technologies are used for this project?

This project is built with:

- Vite
- TypeScript
- React
- shadcn-ui
- Tailwind CSS
- Convex (Backend)
- Supabase (Database)
- Stripe (Payments)

## Convex Backend Connection

This application connects to a Convex backend deployment at:
**https://accomplished-swordfish-668.convex.cloud**

You can access the Convex dashboard at:
[Convex Dashboard](https://dashboard.convex.dev/d/accomplished-swordfish-668)

### Verification

To verify that Convex is properly configured:

1. Check that the `VITE_CONVEX_URL` environment variable is set correctly
2. When the application loads, you should see "âœ… Convex client initialized successfully" in the browser console
3. The dashboard shows a Convex Status Indicator showing the connection status
4. You can visit `/convex-status.html` to see deployment information

### Fallback Mode

If Convex is temporarily unavailable, the application gracefully degrades to demo mode:
- User authentication uses mock data
- Exam questions are served from local data
- Progress tracking is simulated
- All features remain functional
