## Key Components

### Backend Service (`src/services/stripe/backend.ts`)
Central service handling all Stripe operations:
- `createPaymentIntent` - Creates payment intents for subscriptions
- `handleWebhook` - Processes webhook events from Stripe
- `generateReceipt` - Generates payment receipts
- `processRefund` - Handles refund requests
- `getSubscriptionDetails` - Fetches user subscription information
- `cancelSubscription` - Cancels user subscriptions
- `updateSubscriptionPlan` - Updates subscription plans

### Webhook Handler (`src/services/stripe/webhook.ts`)
Handles incoming webhook events from Stripe:
- `stripeWebhookHandler` - Express middleware handler
- `stripeWebhookServerless` - Serverless function handler
- `testWebhook` - Development/testing utility

### Subscription Manager (`src/components/SubscriptionManager.tsx`)
UI component for managing subscriptions:
- Displays current subscription details
- Allows subscription cancellation
- Enables plan switching
- Shows receipt history
- Provides refund options

### Refund Manager (`src/components/RefundManager.tsx`)
UI component for processing refunds:
- Form for entering payment details
- Full/partial refund options
- Reason selection
- Validation and error handling

## Integration Points

### StripeCheckout Component
Updated to use the new backend service for payment intent creation:
```typescript
// Create payment intent on the backend
const paymentIntentData = await createBackendPaymentIntent({
  planId: plan.id,
  userId: user._id,
  email: user.email
});
```

### Subscription Management Page
Integrated the new SubscriptionManager component for comprehensive subscription management.

### Pricing Page
Updated payment success handler to include receipt generation.

## Security Considerations

- Implemented proper error handling to prevent information leakage
- Added validation for all user inputs

## Testing

### Development Utilities
- Created mock implementations for all Stripe operations
