    baseQuestion: "What is the function of the Power Transfer Unit (PTU) in the A320 hydraulic system?",
    options: [
      "Transfers hydraulic power between Green and Yellow systems automatically",
      "Provides emergency hydraulic power from Blue system to all systems",
      "Boosts engine-driven pump pressure during high demand",
      "Converts electrical power to hydraulic power for backup operation"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: "The PTU automatically transfers hydraulic power between the Green and Yellow systems when a pressure differential of more than 500 PSI is detected. It operates as a hydraulic motor-pump unit, using pressure from one system to drive a pump in the other system, ensuring adequate hydraulic power for flight controls and other critical systems.",
    difficulty: "advanced",

  },
  {
    baseQuestion: "What happens to flight controls in case of total loss of all hydraulic systems?",
    options: [
      "Mechanical backup through cables for pitch and roll, rudder via mechanical backup",
      "Complete loss of flight controls, aircraft uncontrollable",
      "Electric backup for all flight controls with reduced authority",
      "Autopilot takes over with emergency power supply"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: "In case of total hydraulic failure, the A320 has a mechanical backup system. Pitch control is available through the trimmable horizontal stabilizer (THS) controlled by pitch trim wheels, and roll control is available through cables to the ailerons. The rudder has a mechanical backup via the rudder pedals, though with reduced authority. This ensures basic aircraft control for emergency landing.",
    difficulty: "advanced",
    reference: "A320 FCOM 2.27.40 - Backup Systems"

  {
    baseQuestion: "What is the normal operating pressure of the A320 hydraulic systems?",
    options: [
      "3000 PSI ± 200 PSI",
      "2500 PSI ± 150 PSI",
      "3500 PSI ± 300 PSI",
      "2800 PSI ± 100 PSI"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: "The A320 hydraulic systems operate at a normal pressure of 3000 PSI with a tolerance of ±200 PSI. This high pressure ensures rapid and powerful actuation of flight controls, landing gear, brakes, and other critical systems while maintaining system reliability.",
    difficulty: "intermediate",
    reference: "A320 FCOM 2.27.10 - Hydraulic Systems"
  },
  {
    baseQuestion: "During which conditions does the PTU automatically activate in the A320?",
    options: [
      "When pressure differential exceeds 500 PSI between Green and Yellow systems",
      "Whenever one engine is shut down",
      "During takeoff and landing phases only",
      "When Blue system pressure drops below 1500 PSI"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: "The PTU automatically activates when the pressure differential between the Green and Yellow hydraulic systems exceeds 500 PSI. This typically occurs when one engine-driven pump fails or when there is a significant demand on one system that the other can help support.",
    difficulty: "intermediate",
    reference: "A320 FCOM 2.27.10 - Hydraulic Systems"
  },
  {
    baseQuestion: "What is the minimum hydraulic pressure required for normal brake operation?",
    options: [
      "2000 PSI minimum for normal braking",
      "1500 PSI minimum for normal braking",
      "2500 PSI minimum for normal braking",
      "1800 PSI minimum for normal braking"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: "Normal brake operation requires a minimum hydraulic pressure of 2000 PSI. Below this pressure, brake effectiveness is reduced, and alternate braking methods may be required. The brake system is designed to provide adequate stopping power within this pressure range.",
    difficulty: "intermediate",
