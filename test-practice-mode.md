# Test Plan: Practice Mode with Answer Verification and History

## Functionality Implemented

### 1. Answer Verification and Explanation
- ✅ **Answer Selection**: In practice mode, users can select an answer without immediately submitting
- ✅ **Confirm Button**: "Confirmar Respuesta" button appears when an answer is selected
- ✅ **Visual Feedback**: After confirmation, correct answers show green with checkmark, incorrect answers show red with X
- ✅ **Answer Explanation**: Detailed explanation appears after confirming the answer
- ✅ **Correct Answer Display**: For incorrect answers, the correct answer is highlighted in green

### 2. Practice History Saving
- ✅ **Session Tracking**: Practice sessions are saved with sessionType: "practice"
- ✅ **Complete Data Storage**: Saves score, time spent, question count, and individual answers
- ✅ **Progress Recording**: Records activity in userProgress table for points and achievements
- ✅ **Incorrect Question Tracking**: Automatically tracks incorrect answers for review mode

### 3. User Experience Improvements
- ✅ **Mode-Specific Behavior**: Practice mode has different flow than timed/review modes
- ✅ **Navigation Control**: Next button is disabled until answer is confirmed in practice mode
- ✅ **Success Messages**: Different completion messages based on mode type
- ✅ **Previous Question Support**: Can navigate back and see previous answers/explanations

## Test Steps

### Test Practice Mode Flow:
1. Navigate to `/exam?mode=practice&category=sistemas-aeronave`
2. Select an answer option
3. Click "Confirmar Respuesta" button
4. Verify explanation appears with correct/incorrect indication
5. Click "Siguiente" to proceed to next question
6. Complete several questions and finish the practice
7. Check that session is saved in exam history

### Test Answer Verification:
1. Select a correct answer → Should show green checkmark and positive explanation
2. Select an incorrect answer → Should show red X, explanation, and highlight correct answer
3. Navigate back to previous question → Should maintain answer state and explanation

### Test History Saving:
1. Complete a practice session
2. Navigate to exam history/dashboard
3. Verify practice session appears with:
   - Session type: "practice"
   - Correct score calculation
   - Time spent tracking
   - Completion timestamp

## Database Schema Updates Used

The implementation leverages existing schema:
- `userExamSessions` table for practice history
- `userIncorrectQuestions` table for review mode preparation
- `userProgress` table for points and achievements
- `completeExamSession` mutation for saving practice results

## Key Code Changes

1. **ExamMode.tsx**: Added practice-specific UI flow with answer verification
2. **useExam.tsx**: Updated to use correct sessionType for different modes
3. **Answer Selection Logic**: Separate logic for practice vs timed/review modes
4. **Navigation Flow**: Practice mode requires confirmation before proceeding

The implementation maintains compatibility with existing timed and review modes while adding the requested verification and history functionality for practice mode.
